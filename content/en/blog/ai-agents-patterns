We're back! In the [first blog post](https://rootflag.io/ai-workflows/) in this series, we talked about some LLM powered workflows and how they aren't agentic solutions or design patterns, but they can be. In this entry I want to touch on the hype of  Agentic Design Patterns.

We all know everyone is all about agents and agentic solutions right now. The goal of agentic systems is to really make a system more autonomous. Hopefully, after reading this post, you'll be able to look at a design pattern and draw a parallel to how many humans breakdown problems as well.

### Agent based design patterns
Let's go over some of the more common design patterns we're seeing currently. 

#### Tool Based
The Tool Based pattern is one of the most common agentic design patterns currently. It has been largely adopted due to how much it can significantly increase the usefulness of a system. Being able to give an Agent the ability to query a dataset or search the web for an answer is very strong.

#### Multi Agent
Multi Agent systems work on the idea of delegation to different agents. When something is passed off to an agent, it is assume that the particular agent has a specific LLM based purpose and will return a result within the expected structured response.

There are a few types of multi agent patterns:
- Hierarchical Agent systems: A system that has structured agents with 'sub' agents that have larger conditional decision making.
- Supervised Agent systems: A system that has a agent supervisor that coordinates agent tasks, results and verification.
- Collaborative Agent Systems: A system that uses agents to build on each other for a singular final results.
#### Planning Breakdown
The Planning Breakdown pattern is based on breaking down a larger problem into smaller and more digestable chunks. This pattern is easiest to think about in terms of a roadmap. The system will break down the request into a form of roadmap. The agent and/or system can then iterate on the results of the roadmap as it completes them.

Just like multi agent systems - planning systems have additional types as well.
