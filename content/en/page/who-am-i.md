Well, lets see I'm a loving father and husband. Total Cyber Security nerd, fighting game addict and avid e-sports watcher.

I tend to think that single player games are a good escape, yet really boring. The majority of my gaming life is a competition. If I'm not getting better or playing against someone to improve, it's just not fun for me.

I tend to write code, use it and then delete it thinking I'll never really need it again. I've worked for fortune 500 companies as a Senior Systems Engineer, Red Team Leader, Security Engineer as well as InfoSec Manager. I've also done a large portion of work that is under NDA yet very vital to the person I've become today.

Honestly, I wake up every morning wondering how I got so lucky and I am thankful for it **every**. **single**. **day**.
